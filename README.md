# Billiards

Code related to a billiards project. We're primarly storing exploratory code related to the hexagon. There's a matlab file which outputs lo and hi periods for many constructed (x,y) pairs which produce initial angle within (30,60), and there's R code to process the data by partitioning it into planar groups, producing the period formula.
